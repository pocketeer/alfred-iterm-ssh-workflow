## Requirements

This workflow assumes two things:
* You use [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) instead of the default Terminal app.
* You use the `~/.ssh/config` file to [store custom connection options](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-custom-connection-options-for-your-ssh-client).

## Usage

Use the keyword `ssh` to trigger the workflow, then hit space. You will see a list of all the available connections defined in your `~/.ssh/config` file. Select the desired connection and it will launch in a new iTerm tab.
